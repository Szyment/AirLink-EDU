# AirLink EDU

## Project Description
A **school air quality station** with **live data displayed in the lobby**. Teachers get ready-to-use lesson materials, administration knows **when to ventilate**, and students work with **real data** in projects. Funded by a **Business Angel**. **Deployment: 8–10 weeks**, maintenance: **up to 10 minutes per month**. Future plan: connect schools in Poland and Japan for joint analytics and environmental education.
